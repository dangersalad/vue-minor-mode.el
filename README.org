* ~vue-minor-mode~

** Installation

   Emacs users may install the package from MELPA, and then add the following to their init.el:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'vue-minor-mode)

     ;; web-mode serves as a good base mode for viewing the entire file
     ;; (especially when using regular css and javascript), but you could
     ;; also use vue-mode
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.vue\\'" . web-mode))
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.vue\\'" . vue-minor-mode))
   #+END_SRC

** Usage

   Inside the ~.vue~ file, with the cursor in any of the ~<template>~,
   ~<script>~, or ~<style>~ blocks, press ~C-c '~ and a new editing
   buffer will open up with the appropriate major mode for that code
   block

   In the edit buffer, the following commands are available:

   - `C-c '` - Finish editing and replace the code block you are editing in the main file
   - `C-c C-k` - Cancel your edits and close the edit buffer, leaving the original buffer intact
   - `C-x C-s` - Replace your edited block in the original file and save the original file, leaving the edit window open
